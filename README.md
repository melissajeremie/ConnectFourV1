# Connect Four, V1

## Module 1 Project

A JavaScript app based on the classic color connection game [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four). In this two player game, users try to get 4 cells of their color in a row before their opponent does.

### Technologies Used

* JavaScript
* jQuery
* HTML
* CSS
* Github

### Approach Taken

I began by wireframing the simple game layout I wanted to create. 
Then I began to map out the logic for the game, which was not as simple as it originally appeared. The most challenging part of this logic was the win checks: making sure that 4 colored cells in consecutive vertical, horizontal or (1 of 2) diagonal rows created a win state for the game.

### Unsolved Problems

* Score keeping for multiple game rounds
* Game reset
